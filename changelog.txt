Release 2021-12
 - `splunk-library-javalogging`, which depends on `log4j`, updated from `1.11.0`,
        new version `1.11.1` to address recently found CVE. In FlowCrypt products,
        splunk-library-javalogging is only used when property `logger.types` is
        set to include `SplunkHttpLogger`.

Release 2021-11:
 - (BREAKING) previously, property api.hostname accepted an array of values and was
        used for two purposes: server hostname and also accepted host headers. The
        first value was used for hostname, and any value in the array would be accepted
        for incoming host header. api.hostname no longer accepts multiple values, and
        should only contain one value which is the host value for the server, and
        excludes port number. To control which host headers are accepted, use a new
        property api.accept.hosts which may be an array of values, including port numbers.
